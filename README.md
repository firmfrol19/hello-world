# hello-world
This repository is part of my iniciation in the "Github world" - my iniciation in a amazing and very useful tool that potentially will agreggate value, consistency and transparency to my projects, mainly projects of my academic life. Also this is a part of my task to learn the "toolkit to data scientists" - a course of the the John Hopkins University (on Coursera).
